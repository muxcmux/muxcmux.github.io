      <description>I recently bought a new computer. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have timed it better even if I wanted to. My everyday laptop has started exhibiting the notorious keyboard problem and brought my productivity down to that of a goldfish. Off to the Apple Store to get it sorted (more on that in a future post) and on with setting up a Linux on my new workstation.
Last time I tried this exercise was about a decade ago, so stepping into unfamiliar territory I went for something popular - Pop OS!</description>

      <description>Nostalgia hit me the other day while watching a random YouTube video of a guy building a PC. This and the fact that I&amp;rsquo;ve been toying around with the idea of getting a small computer for my desk at home led me to make an impulsive purchase of this little ASRock A300.
It&amp;rsquo;s absolutely brilliant with size comparable to the original mac mini, maybe even smaller. Not entirely sure of the exact purpose of this build, I picked up the Ryzen 3200G, 16G of memory, the cheapest 250GB solid state drive I could find from Scan, a wifi card, and a Noctua slim fan.</description>

      <description>All the information here was compiled by me looking at the library folder, examining the sqlite databases, monitoring changes in files, hexdumping, etc. while playing around with my personal photos collection.
Do what you want with this, but keep in mind it is unofficial and solely based on my personal observations, therefore it is incomplete and some parts could be plain wrong.
Apple may change how their software works at any time and without notice.</description>
