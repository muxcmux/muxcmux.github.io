      <description>Nostalgia hit me the other day while watching a random YouTube video of a guy building a PC. This and the fact that I&amp;rsquo;ve been toying around with the idea of getting a small computer for my desk at home led me to make an impulsive purchase of this little ASRock A300.
It&amp;rsquo;s absolutely brilliant with size comparable to the original mac mini, maybe even smaller. Not entirely sure of the exact purpose of this build, I picked up the Ryzen 3200G, 16G of memory, the cheapest 250GB solid state drive I could find from Scan, a wifi card, and a Noctua slim fan.</description>

      <description>All the information here was compiled by me looking at the library folder, examining the sqlite databases, monitoring changes in files, hexdumping, etc. while playing around with my personal photos collection.
Do what you want with this, but keep in mind it is unofficial and solely based on my personal observations, therefore it is incomplete and some parts could be plain wrong.
Apple may change how their software works at any time and without notice.</description>
