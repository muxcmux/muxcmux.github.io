      <h2 id="metropolitan-thames-valley">Metropolitan Thames Valley</h2>
<p>MTVH needed help moving their stack of Rails apps from being built by an agency to developing them in-house.</p>
<p>My role required transferring knowledge to the in-house dev team (<em>capability building</em> I think is the buzz word). I mentored and provided guidance to junior engineers, schooling them in various programming topics - both practical and theoretical, while taking part in regular sprint work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve extended my contract to oversee the completion of the transition, finish some important improvements on their residents&rsquo; portal, and onboard my worthy two senior successors who I also helped in hiring.</p>
<h2 id="caboodle-storage">Caboodle Storage</h2>
<p>Lot&rsquo;s of fun there. These guys liked me so much they asked me to extend my contract <strong>twice</strong>! It&rsquo;s a startup that ships boxes to your door, you fill them up and they take them away to a warehouse to be stored for a monthly fee. Neat.</p>
<p>My initial contract was to build their client-facing app. It turned out quite well and they suggested I build a bespoke warehouse app for them. This was a lot more fun as I got to integrate with Zebra RFID printers, tinker with UHF handheld scanners (and their utterly terrible chinese SDKs), write some APIs, and last but not least - drive a fork lift around.</p>
<p>During the second extension I went to the bitter end to get 97% on SiteSpeed. I also did the the Stripe PSD2 migration (doh) and some other general maintenance tasks.</p>
<h2 id="plandek">Plandek</h2>
<p>Spent a year or so working with a great team of devs on building an Ember app from the ground up. It&rsquo;s essentially a business intelligence tool which gathers data from a bunch of sources and then allows executives to create interactive chart dashboards.</p>
<p>The engineering highlight for me was authoring a modular charting library on top of Ember components and D3. I needed a refresh on my linear algebra and Cartesian geometry knowledge but I did have loads of fun building it.</p>
<p>This project was directly talking to a Rails backend, which I helped maintain as well.</p>
<h2 id="artirix">Artirix</h2>
<p>My first proper Rails developer job. These are the people who built Globrix, which was later acquired by Zoopla. I worked on a bunch of different projects there, including search portals for DowJones&rsquo; property classifieds, EstatesGazette, BoatInternational, and a nifty startup which tackles rare diseases called RareMark.</p>
<p>Other things I was involved with were dealing with different data backends in Python, Elasticsearch (even Solr at some point, remember that?) and even wrote a small iOS eBay clone app with a colleague, but most importantly - I played lot&rsquo;s of Fifa on the PS3/4, aahh the good old times.</p>
<h2 id="vertinity">Vertinity</h2>
<p>This is where it all began. I don&rsquo;t remember great details and honestly don&rsquo;t really want to remember the days of IE6 support. Anyways, made lots of friends there and had great mentors while building various PHP websites for all kinds of companies and e-commerce websites.</p>
